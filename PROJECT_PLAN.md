## Project Overview

A simple, modern time tracking application built with React and Tailwind CSS. Users can log hours spent on tasks, view summaries by day/week/month/year, and manage their time entries with a clean, responsive UI.

## User Stories

- **As a user, I want to add a new time entry with a date, hours, and task description, so I can track my work.**
- **As a user, I want to view my time entries by day, week, month, and year, so I can analyze my productivity.**
- **As a user, I want to edit or delete existing entries, so I can correct mistakes.**
- **As a user, I want to quickly navigate between different periods (e.g., previous/next week), so I can review my history.**
- **As a user, I want to see total hours for each period, so I can monitor my workload.**
- **As a user, I want a responsive and visually appealing interface, so I can use the app comfortably on any device.**
- **As a user, I want to search for entries by task, so I can find specific work logs.**
- **As a user, I want to export my data, so I can use it elsewhere.**

## Phases & Milestones

### PHASE 1: Planning & Setup

**Milestone 1: Project Setup**

- Initialize React project (Vite or Create React App)
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- Establish base folder structure:
  - `src/components/`
  - `src/views/`
  - `src/hooks/`
  - `src/utils/`
  - `src/data/` (for mock data)
  - `src/App.jsx`
- Set up version control (Git)
- Add README and initial documentation

### PHASE 2: Data Structure & State

**Milestone 2: Data Modeling**

- Define time entry structure:
  ```js
  {
    id: string,
    date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
    hours: number,
    task: string
  }
  ```
- Store entries in top-level state (useState or context)
- Create mock data for development
- (Optional) Implement custom hooks for data access/mutation

### PHASE 3: UI Components

**Milestone 3: Build Reusable Components**

- `EntryForm`: Add/edit entries
- `EntryCard`: Display a single entry
- `PeriodSummary`: Show total hours for current filter
- `NavigationControls`: Change periods
- `EmptyState`: Display when no entries exist
- Ensure components are modular and reusable

### PHASE 4: View Modes & Navigation

**Milestone 4: Routing or Conditional Rendering**

- Implement toggling between Day, Week, Month, Year views (state or URL params)

**Milestone 5: View Implementations**

- **Day View:**
  - Show full entry details for selected date
  - Editable via EntryForm
- **Week View:**
  - Loop through 7 days; show summary of hours/tasks
  - Weekly total at the bottom
- **Month View:**
  - Display a calendar grid
  - Each day shows total hours if any
- **Year View:**
  - Show a card/grid per month with total hours

### PHASE 5: Navigation & Date Management

**Milestone 6: Navigation Controls**

- Add date picker
- Add "Previous / Next" buttons for current view
- Add "Today" quick-jump button
- Utility functions to:
  - Get start/end of current week/month/year
  - Navigate between periods

### PHASE 6: State Management & Persistence

**Milestone 7: Efficient State Handling**

- Centralize time entries in state
- Use useEffect to derive filtered data for active view
- (Optional) Add localStorage or backend persistence

### PHASE 7: Tailwind Styling

**Milestone 8: UI/UX**

- Clean layout with grid/flex utilities
- Consistent color scheme
- Responsive design (media queries or Tailwind breakpoints)
- Add visual feedback:
  - Loading states
  - Form validation
  - Toasts/alerts for saving/deleting

### PHASE 8: Extra Features (Optional)

**Milestone 9: Advanced Features**

- Search bar to filter entries by task
- Export button (download JSON/CSV)
- Print-friendly view
- (Optional) User authentication

### PHASE 9: Testing & Polish

**Milestone 10: QA & Polish**

- Test all views with/without data
- Ensure totals are accurate
- Test responsive layout on multiple devices
- Refactor repeated logic
- Add comments and documentation
